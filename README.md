# Problem 2: Asteroid Collision Simulator


# 📚 Libraries Used

## NumPy
- Used for array manipulation and mathematical operations  
- Install:  
  pip install numpy

## Matplotlib
- Used for creating visualizations and animations  
- Install:  
  pip install matplotlib

## Additional Modules (Pre-installed)
- matplotlib.patches: Used to create polygon shapes for asteroids  
- matplotlib.animation: Used to generate the animation of asteroid movements  
- math: Used for calculations like distance between points  
- random: Used to generate irregular asteroid shapes  
- time: Used to measure execution time  


# 📁 File Structure

- main.py – Main simulation and animation code  
- requirements.txt – Used as input file, contains asteroid data  
- sample_output/ – Output folder with collision results and animation video  


# ▶️ How to Run

- Place your asteroid data in requirements.txt  
- Run the program:  
  python main.py  


# 📤 Output

- Console: Displays collision events  
- File: sample_output/collisions.txt  
- Animation: Displayed in a pop-up window and optionally saved as asteroid_collision_animation.mp4
